#Project Description
  In this project, we intend to use a neural network in order to read a song input, and then classify it based on its likelihood to be a particular genre. The genres we will be classifying are rock, hip-hop, pop, classical, jazz, and country. The goal of the project is to be able to feed the network any song, and have it classify the song as one of the aforementioned genres. The architecture we intend to use will be a convolutional neural network, due to its ability to use fewer parameters than other architectures, since we will likely only be using spectrogram data derived from our audio files.
